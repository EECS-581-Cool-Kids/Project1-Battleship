# Estimated Time Required
(copied from original google sheet)

- 5 days x 1 hours/day + 2 days x 3  hours/day = **12 hours per team member per week**
- 12 hours per week x 2 weeks = **24 hours per team member total**
- 5 team members x 24 hours = **120 hours estimated total time required**

- this assumes team members will work 1 hour per day every weekday on average and 3 hours per day on weekends
